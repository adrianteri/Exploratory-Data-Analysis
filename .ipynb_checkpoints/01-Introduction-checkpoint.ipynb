    "## Why we do  EDA\n",

    "\n",
    "**Reasons for the analyst**\n",
    "* Identify patterns and develop hypotheses.\n",
    "* Test technical assumptions.\n",
    "* Inform model selection and feature engineering.\n",
    "* Build an intuition for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons for consumer of analysis**\n",
    "* Ensures delivery of technically-sound results.\n",
    "* Ensures right question is being asked.\n",
    "* Tests business assumptions.\n",
    "* Provides context necessary for maximum applicability and value of results.\n",
    "* Leads to insights that would otherwise not be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to keep in mind \n",
    "* You're never done with EDA. With every analytical result, you want to return to EDA, make sure the result makes sense, test other questions that come up because of it.  \n",
    "* Stay open-minded. You're supposed to be challenging your assumptions and those of the stakeholder who you're performing the analysis for. \n",
    "* Repeat EDA for every new problem. Just because you've done EDA on a dataset before doesn't mean you shouldn't do it again for the next problem. You need to look at the data through the lense of the problem at hand and you will likely have different areas of investigation.\n"

    "* Record things to watch out for/ be aware of in future analyses. \n",
    "* Show intermediate results to colleagues to get a fresh perspective, feedback, domain knowledge. Don't do EDA in a bubble! Get feedback throughout especially from people removed from the problem and/or with relevant domain knowledge. \n",
    "* Position visuals and results together. EDA relies on your natural pattern recognition abilities so maximize what you'll find by putting visualizations and results in close proximity. "
